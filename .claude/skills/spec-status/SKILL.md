# spec-status

Run `sh .claude/skills/spec-status/scripts/spec-status.sh project-repositories.yaml <spec> status`.
Use `--remote` for current GitHub PR comparisons and `--json` for structured output.
The command is read-only and does not fetch. Report unknown remote state honestly.
For a legacy spec, use the explicit `init` command before recording slices.
Read [delivery guidance](../../../docs/DELIVERY.md) for the schema, working agreement,
and evidence requirements. Reconcile the record after each review and merge;
do not infer whole-spec completion from a single merged PR.
