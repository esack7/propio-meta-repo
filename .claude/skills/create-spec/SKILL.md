# create-spec

Create `specs/<spec-name>/` with tracked specification documents and a confirmed `repos.txt`.

## When to use

- "Create a spec for …"
- `/create-spec <feature description>` (Claude Code), `$create-spec <feature description>` (Codex), or `/skill create-spec <feature description>` (Propio)

## Spec naming

- Must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`.
- Reject if `specs/<spec-name>/` already exists.

## Workflow

1. **Gather requirements** from the user (or the provided feature description).
2. **Read** `project-repositories.yaml` and propose affected repositories using each entry's `description`, `selection.use_for`, and `selection.avoid_for`.
3. **Present the exact repository name list** and obtain explicit user confirmation. Do not guess after confirmation.
4. **Run the bundled helper** to create the spec directory (agents must not hand-author `repos.txt` or spec paths):

```sh
sh .claude/skills/create-spec/scripts/create-spec.sh project-repositories.yaml <spec-name> \
  --summary "<one-line summary>" repo-a repo-b
```

5. Edit the generated Markdown files with gathered requirements. Plan all known slices, dependencies, acceptance IDs, and the existing working agreement in generated `delivery.json` using [delivery guidance](../../../docs/DELIVERY.md). Commit the initial plan deliberately; keep `tasks.md` linked to delivery state rather than copying statuses. Do not hand-edit `repos.txt` after confirmation.

## Correcting repository selection

Before `prepare-spec` creates any feature branch or worktree, obtain confirmation of the complete replacement repository list and run:

```sh
sh .claude/skills/create-spec/scripts/create-spec.sh project-repositories.yaml <spec-name> \
  --amend repo-a repo-b
```

The helper atomically replaces only `repos.txt`. It refuses amendments if feature worktrees, worktree registrations, or `feature/<spec-name>` branches already exist. In that state, use a new spec name so the old repository selection remains durable.

## repos.txt rules

- One `name` per line matching `project-repositories.yaml`.
- Blank lines and `#` comments allowed.
- No duplicate or unknown names.

## Next steps

For a spec-only request, report the created plan. If implementation is already authorized, continue with **setup-repositories** as needed and **prepare-spec** without asking the user to repeat that authorization.

Do **not** create worktrees or branches in this skill.

See [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) for the specification lifecycle.
