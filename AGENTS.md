# Meta-Repo Agent Guidance

This meta-repo maps multiple Git repositories for cross-repo planning and feature work. Reference clones live under `repos/` (ignored by Git). Feature work uses isolated worktrees under `specs/<spec-name>/repos/` (also ignored). Specification documents and `repos.txt` are tracked.

Inspired by [The Meta Repo: The AI Map of Your Codebase](https://bsokol.substack.com/p/the-meta-repo-the-ai-map-of-your).

## Repository index

Use [`project-repositories.yaml`](project-repositories.yaml) as the canonical project map. For each repository entry:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Unique local directory name and `repos.txt` identifier. Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$` (single path component, no separators or traversal). |
| `description` | Concise repository purpose. |
| `git.clone_url` | Canonical clone URL. |
| `git.default_branch` | Default branch ref (for example `main`). |
| `context` | Ordered context-file paths (for example `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`) to load when working in that clone. |
| `key_directories` | Optional `path` and `description` entries for navigation. |
| `selection.use_for` | When to propose this repository for a feature. |
| `selection.avoid_for` | When not to propose this repository. |

Git-critical fields (`name`, `git.clone_url`, `git.default_branch`) use a constrained layout documented below. Workflow helpers read these values directly; agents must not transcribe or improvise them.

### Example entry

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: api-service
    description: Public HTTP API
    git:
      clone_url: https://github.com/example/api-service.git
      default_branch: main
    context:
      - AGENTS.md
      - README.md
    key_directories:
      - path: src/handlers
        description: Route handlers
    selection:
      use_for: API endpoints, request validation, OpenAPI changes
      avoid_for: Frontend UI, mobile clients
```

### Constrained Git-critical layout

Helpers accept only this formatting for Git-critical fields:

- Top level: `version: 1` and `repositories:` as a block list, or the starter form `repositories: []`.
- Each repository block starts with `  - name: <value>` (two spaces, block style).
- The nested `git:` block uses four-space indentation; `clone_url` and `default_branch` use six-space indentation.
- `name`, `clone_url`, and `default_branch` are single-line scalars with no inline comments, YAML anchors, aliases, or flow-style mappings.

Rich descriptive fields (`description`, `context`, `key_directories`, `selection`) use normal YAML. Unsupported critical-field formatting is rejected.

## Cross-repo work

1. Load [`project-repositories.yaml`](project-repositories.yaml) to see which repositories exist and how they relate.
2. For the repositories selected for your task (from a spec's `repos.txt` or explicit user direction), open the reference clone under `repos/<name>/` and read each path listed in `context` **in configured order** before making changes.
3. Reference-clone **working trees** are not modified during feature work. Feature changes happen in worktrees under `specs/<spec-name>/repos/`. Fetches, worktree metadata, and explicit fast-forward refreshes may update Git metadata or the checked-out default branch of reference clones.
4. When current remote context matters (planning, comparing branches, verifying upstream state), run **refresh-repositories** on the relevant reference clones before cross-repo planning.

## Workflows (skills)

Invoke workflows through your agent's native skill syntax or natural language.

| Workflow | Codex | Claude Code | Propio | Natural language examples |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Clone missing reference repos | `$setup-repositories` | `/setup-repositories` | `/skill setup-repositories` | "set up the project repositories" |
| Fast-forward reference clones | `$refresh-repositories` | `/refresh-repositories` | `/skill refresh-repositories` | "refresh the reference clones" |
| Start a feature spec | `$create-spec <description>` | `/create-spec <description>` | `/skill create-spec <description>` | "create a spec for tags" |
| Create feature worktrees | `$prepare-spec <spec-name>` | `/prepare-spec <spec-name>` | `/skill prepare-spec <spec-name>` | "prepare the tags spec" |
| Remove feature worktrees | `$close-spec <spec-name>` | `/close-spec <spec-name>` | `/skill close-spec <spec-name>` | "close the tags spec" |
| Inspect delivery state | `$spec-status` | `/spec-status` | `/skill spec-status` | "what remains in this spec?" |
| Start a PR slice | `$start-slice` | `/start-slice` | `/skill start-slice` | "start the next planned slice" |
| Verify package artifacts | `$verify-packages` | `/verify-packages` | `/skill verify-packages` | "test a packed package against its consumer" |
| Link local package checkouts | `$link-local-packages` | `/link-local-packages` | `/skill link-local-packages` | "link providers into the agent locally" |

Canonical skills live under `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`. Codex discovers thin compatibility wrappers under `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`; those wrappers point back to the canonical skill and contain no helper copies. Propio discovers the canonical definitions through `.propio/skills/<skill-name>` symlinks. Cursor discovers `link-local-packages` through `.cursor/commands/<skill-name>.md` (as `/link-local-packages`) and `.cursor/rules/<skill-name>.mdc`; both are wrappers pointing back to the canonical skill.

**Safety rule:** Bundled helpers own reference-clone setup/refresh, spec directory and `repos.txt` creation/amendment, feature-worktree creation/removal, slice branch switching/registration, and local package links. Do not reproduce or bypass those helpers. Ordinary source/document edits, delivery-record updates, tests, commits, pushes, and PR preparation within the authorized scope use normal tools. Work on the meta-repo itself may use a separate branch or isolated checkout without creating a cross-repository spec. Merging, publishing, and external messages follow the user's authorization.

## Delivery coordination

Use [docs/DELIVERY.md](docs/DELIVERY.md) for the delivery record, working agreement,
acceptance evidence, and package validation. `delivery.json` is the authoritative
slice/PR/status record; `repos.txt` remains the authoritative repository selection.
Record the user's existing authorization once and continue approved work without
repeated confirmation. Preserve explicit assessment-only requests. At each review
handoff report the slice, evidence, remaining scope, next action, and actual decision
needed. Update state after a merge before advancing. A merged slice, verified spec,
and removed worktrees are separate milestones.

Plan criteria and risk-specific checks before implementation. Use `spec-status`
when resuming or asking what remains; use `--remote` when current PR state matters.
Use `start-slice` for each new PR branch, and keep branch/evidence history through
closeout. Do not suggest completion until every criterion and slice is verified.

### setup-repositories

Clones missing repositories into `repos/<name>/`. Existing valid clones are left exactly as-is (no fetch, pull, checkout, or reset). Requires network only when cloning.

### refresh-repositories

Fast-forwards clean reference clones on their configured default branch. Refuses dirty, divergent, locally-ahead, or wrong-branch clones. Never touches feature worktrees.

### create-spec

Gathers requirements, proposes affected repositories from the project map, obtains confirmation, and creates `specs/<spec-name>/` with `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and `repos.txt`.

- Spec names must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` and must not collide with an existing spec directory.
- `repos.txt` lists one repository `name` per line; it is the sole input for later worktree operations.
- Before preparation, an explicitly confirmed correction may atomically replace `repos.txt` through the helper's `--amend` mode. Amendment is refused after any feature branch, worktree, or worktree registration exists so historical repository selection remains durable.

### prepare-spec

Validates `repos.txt`, requires reference clones under `repos/<name>/`, fetches and prunes `origin`, and verifies every `origin/<default_branch>` before creating anything. It then creates `feature/<spec-name>` worktrees under `specs/<spec-name>/repos/`, rolling back newly created clean worktrees and unchanged branches if a later creation fails. It skips an already-correct worktree on the expected feature branch without requiring it to be clean. Registered slice branches are also accepted. Other branches are refused. Reopening uses the latest registered slice branch (or the original feature branch); retained branch reuse requires explicit authorization.

### close-spec

Two-phase safety check across all listed repositories. Delivery-aware specs additionally require verified acceptance and current merge evidence, including exact PR-head proof for squash merges. Explicit `--worktrees-only` allows early cleanup without certifying completion. Legacy specs retain cleanup semantics. On success, removes worktrees and prunes metadata only—never deletes branches or specification documents.

### link-local-packages

Makes a change in one repository testable in the repositories that consume it without publishing a package version first. Reads each local `package.json`, discovers which local checkouts depend on which, and replaces the published copy inside a consumer's `node_modules` with a symlink to the local checkout.

Writes only inside `node_modules/`; never edits `package.json`, a lockfile, or Git state. Supports `status`, `link`, and `unlink`, scoped to `repos/` by default or to `specs/<spec-name>/repos/` with `--spec`.

Preflight-first, consistent with the other workflows: every edge is validated before any change is applied, so a failure on one consumer cannot leave another half-linked. Only symlinks pointing at the expected local checkout are removed—one owned by something else is reported as `foreign` and left alone. Destinations resolve against the physical `node_modules` directory, so a symlinked scope directory cannot redirect a write outside it.

Contexts must not be mixed: linking a feature worktree to a reference clone silently tests the wrong branch. Because `npm install` and `npm ci` remove links, re-run `link` after either.

## repos.txt format

- One repository `name` per line (must exist in `project-repositories.yaml`).
- Readers trim surrounding whitespace.
- Blank lines and lines whose first non-whitespace character is `#` are ignored.
- Duplicate or unknown names are rejected.

## Branches and base refs

- Slice branches: `codex/<spec-name>-<slice-id>` registered by `start-slice`; retain them for evidence and reopening.
- Initial feature branches: `feature/<spec-name>` created from `origin/<git.default_branch>` at prepare time.
- Helpers never guess `main`, `master`, or another base branch; they use only `git.default_branch` from the project map.
- Spec names are durable identifiers. Reopening an existing spec means running `prepare-spec` against its existing directory with explicit authorization to reuse retained feature branches. A new iteration uses a new spec name.

## Context freshness

- **setup-repositories** does not update existing clones.
- **prepare-spec** fetches before selecting its base ref; it fails with setup guidance when a selected clone is missing.
- **refresh-repositories** updates reference clones when you need current default-branch context.
- **close-spec** fetches during normal preflight; acknowledged offline close uses last-known remote refs and reports that reachability is stale.

## Specification lifecycle

1. **create-spec** — requirements, design, tasks, confirmed `repos.txt`.
2. **prepare-spec** — feature worktrees on `feature/<spec-name>`.
3. Plan slices and acceptance evidence in `delivery.json`; use **start-slice** to implement in worktrees under `specs/<spec-name>/repos/` (not in reference clones).
4. **spec-status** — reconcile evidence and PR state after reviews and merges.
5. **close-spec** — check completion and remove worktrees when done; branches and spec documents remain.

Multiple specs may be active concurrently; paths and branch names provide isolation.

### Reopening a closed spec

Run `prepare-spec <spec-name>` on the existing spec directory and explicitly authorize reuse of retained branches. Delivery-aware specs reopen the latest registered branch per repository; legacy specs reopen `feature/<spec-name>`.

### Manual branch cleanup

After a feature is fully merged, you may delete local and remote `feature/<spec-name>` branches manually when you want to retire them. Do not delete unmerged or unpushed branches you still need. **close-spec** never performs branch deletion.

## Reuse as a template

1. Copy this scaffold or publish it as a Git-host template.
2. Populate `project-repositories.yaml`.
3. Run **setup-repositories**.
4. Create the project's initial commit and remote outside scaffold automation.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Helper rejects project map formatting | Fix `name`, `git.clone_url`, and `git.default_branch` to match the constrained layout. |
| prepare-spec says clone missing | Run **setup-repositories** for that repository. |
| refresh-repositories refuses | Clean the working tree, check out the configured default branch, resolve divergence manually, then retry. |
| prepare-spec branch collision | Use a new spec name, or rerun with explicit branch reuse authorization. |
| close-spec refuses on fetch failure | Fix network or use acknowledged offline close; nothing is removed on failure. |
| close-spec reports unpushed commits | Push, acknowledge retention, or keep the worktree open. |
| Dirty worktree blocks close | Commit, stash elsewhere, or discard changes in the **worktree** (not the reference clone). |

## Agent context loading

When working across repositories for a spec or explicit selection:

1. Read `specs/<spec-name>/repos.txt` (or the user-confirmed list).
2. For each name, resolve `repos/<name>/` (reference) or `specs/<spec-name>/repos/<name>/` (active feature worktree).
3. Load each repository's `context` files from the project map in order before proposing or making changes.
